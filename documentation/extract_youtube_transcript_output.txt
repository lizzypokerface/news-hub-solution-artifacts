>>> EXTRACTED TRANSCRIPT (COMPACT):
[Music] At some point around the 60s, we stopped thinking like people and we started thinking like Yeah. Okay. So, this isn't the whole point of the video, but I do want to show you a quick graph. It's the use of the sentence marketplace of ideas over time. You can see that around the mid60s that sentence just took off. And this makes sense, right? I looked it up on the most authoritative platform I know, Wikipedia. And the first use of free trade in ideas was only in 1919. The first verbatim marketplace of ideas was 34 years later. And it's only a decade after that that it became official policy in Brandenburgg v. Ohio in 1969. That timeline is obviously a big reason for the boom happening when it did. But there's something more to this story. I'm not showing you this graph so I can talk about the metaphor itself. It's not a fantastic metaphor for a ton of reasons which I think are pretty obvious. The myth of the marketplace of ideas that truth somehow always wins when every single opinion, no matter how horrible, is put out there is just obviously not true. Ideas don't really compete in a competitive or level playing field. People don't really assess ideas like their products. The idea that truth always comes out on top is laughable. And just in general, you probably already know that the people who use this sentence pull it out almost exclusively to say bigoted stuff, right? Lots of problems there. Whatever. It is interesting that this metaphor has become so widespread despite its problems. But what I find more interesting about this graph is that it's getting at something deeper. The total takeover of economicish language and ideas about how we make decisions. Something that started in the '60s, but then quickly snowballed to where we are today. It's clearly become very fashionable to think like an economist over the last half century. Without looking too hard, you can find people talking about things like supply and demand and game theory. game theory on just about any topic from politics and public policy all the way down to frankly quite creepy stuff about like the dating market. That's interesting and it's weird. Why did thinking like an economist take off but thinking like an anthropologist, for example, never did? We'll get to why, but first it's pretty clear that this trend has made life worse for most of us. Because if it wasn't obvious from the last hundred videos, already neoliberal economists tend to be [Music] But first, it's ad read time because I've got to pay my bills. Let me show you something real quick. Google your name. I know you have to open another tab or switch apps. Just do it real quick. Odds are some of your personal information comes up, right? If I search my name, it's just my public social media accounts. Want to know why? Because I use Aura, the sponsor of today's video. If you've ever wondered why you're constantly harassed by spam calls, texts, and emails, here's why. There are companies called data brokers whose sole purpose is to find and sell your data. They do it without your consent, and they make billions selling it to marketers, scammers, and even stalkers. And while they're legally required to remove your info if you ask, they make the process confusing and difficult on purpose. This is why I'm always recommending Aura to family and friends. They take care of everything for you. They remove your data from these sites and they keep it removed. Aura is an all-in-one digital security tool. You may already use some other basic app, but not using Aura is like locking your front door, but leaving your back door wide open. And Aura doesn't just fight data brokers. They alert you if your personal data is found on the dark web. They provide real-time fraud alerts for credit and banking, 24/7 identity theft monitoring, a secure VPN, anti virus, parental controls, password manager, credit checker, and more. And if somehow anything does happen, Aura includes $5 million in identity theft insurance, and they have US-based fraud experts on call 24/7. If you're anything like me, I'm sure you're sick and tired of these stupid, evil little companies stealing your personal information and using it to make a quick buck. That's why I use Aura. It keeps me and my family safe online. If you're ready to protect your data, you can get 2 weeks absolutely free when you use my link. During those two weeks, you'll see exactly where your data is being leaked and who's doing it. Give it a try. I promise you'll appreciate the peace of mind. Now, back to the show. You've heard of the prisoner's dilemma before. If not, just picture this. You are one of two prisoners kept in a jail in separate cells. The warden gives you a choice. Confess to your crime and rat out your partner or stay silent. If you confess and your partner doesn't, you walk out scot-free. If you both confess, you both serve 5 years. If neither of you confesses, you both only get one year. But if he confesses and you don't, you'll be the one spending 10 years in jail while he gets to go free, what should you do? For the mathematicians at the Rand Corporation who created this thought experiment in the ' 50s, the rational answer for this standard oneshot of the prisoner's dilemma is to rat out the other guy no matter what. Assume selfishness and be selfish yourself. After all, in most scenarios, ratting the other out will make you better off. And odds are the other guy is thinking the same thing because the same is true for him. If you want, you can do some math using the numbers I gave you earlier and put them into a table like this to calculate exactly what the expected number of years in jail is for every action. The Nash equilibrium, which is usually considered the quote unquote optimal solution for this setup, is to confess. Even though the best collective outcome is for both people to stay silent, each person's best choice is to confess. Now, there have been a ton of variations on the prisoner's dilemma. A set number of rounds versus an infinite number. Different payouts for confessing or being quiet. Swapping freedom and jail time for prize money or torture. Different numbers of players. Different options than just the standard two. People have messed with it quite a bit. And all these variations can give you different optimal strategies and results. Tonight, you're all going to be a part of a social experiment. Each of you has a remote. Blow off the other boat. If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live. So, who's it going to be? But at its inception, the game was meant to reveal something basic and fundamental about humans and how we make decisions. In all of its many iterations, the prisoner's dilemma states that if we just act selfishly about what our expected gains are, we are mathematically rational. It doesn't say you can't cooperate, but it always considers the value of cooperation from the point of view of maximizing the individual's own personal gain. The game always measures what you are doing as rational by whether or not your expectations of reward are as high as possible. Even in versions of the game where the quote unquote mathematically optimal strategy is to prefer cooperation. The thing is that this isn't actually telling us anything about our decision-making process. In real world experiments of the game, people chose the unoptimal strategy all the time, which economists can't explain, so they just call people idiots. But that's because this rationality the game theorists came up with isn't reality. It's a normative claim on what our decision-making process should be. And you can probably already see why there might be some problems with basing rationality on something like the prisoners dilemma. For one, this game is not meant to have you ask questions like, "What if I care about more than the number of years I'll spend in jail? What if I care about the other guy or due process? What if I care about the feeling of betrayal? What commitments do this other person and I have to each other? What if there are social conventions in place that change our expectations about what the other person's going to do? Or at a very basic level, what if we could just talk? Those questions are designed to be outside the game. Plenty of real world evidence shows that people think about stuff like that in situations like the prisoners dilemma, and that different cultures have different approaches to life than just trying to maximize their own personal gain. But on paper, the name of the game is how do you get the fewest years in jail possible and nothing else. And that would be fine if the prisoner's dilemma was just a mathematical experiment. But it's not. And here we go. Like the marketplace of ideas, The Prisoner's Dilemma and the rest of the field of game theory that it's inspired is one of those things that became wildly popular during the mid 20th century. Especially [Music] in economics where most of microeconomics actually changed how it understands value to be similar to the approach used in the prisoners dilemma. Something called expected utility theory. Essentially, because of game theory, economists now assume that people make decisions based on their expectations of getting the best possible outcome for themselves. That wasn't always the case. And since value is probably the most foundational thing in economics, changing that means changing almost everything at once. And it's not just econ. Game theory and exercises like the prisoners dilemma are taught in math departments, political science, sociology, psychology, and environmental studies. Philosophy departments offer courses in logic that heavily rely on game theory. It's been used to study animal behavior and even bacterial organisms. It has even become the metaphor for why countries don't act on climate change after the Stern Review came out in 2006. Formulas developed by game theorists now inform many of our big political decisions. This has had a profound effect. It's reframed rationality to something very specific, expected individual gain. Despite the fact that the prisoners dilemma can be challenged on empirical and theoretical grounds for not including enough for making wild assumptions about how humans think or the fact that rational choice theory is also essentially taught to logical. It defines rationality as people choosing based on their preferences. So by definition every decision that actually occurs is rational. Brilliant work. Really truly amazing stuff. And yet it still took over all these disciplines and aspects of our lives. So now when we think about politics and elections, it's through this specific framing of rationality. And who can blame us? A ton of work is done by pollsters and data scientists and media strategists to find the way to sell a candidate to the public so that the greatest number of people feel like they're maximizing their utility by voting for one guy over another. and to maximize mutual distrust and increase the stakes of rejecting a cooperative alternative. In public policy too, we now analyze political motives and policies not through what is the best collective social outcome and process, democratic debate, and the respect of all people's personhood, but instead through the best possible way to create the conditions in which any one person could technically maximize their own selfish ends, regardless of what that means for others. We put ourselves in the shoes of the guy just trying to look out for himself. Others are no longer entitled to respect, safety, or other considerations that escape the narrow border drawn around me and my family. All they're entitled to is the right to defend themselves from our selfishness, too. As if there was no society, just people duking it out. The problem is that this objectively sucks. And the real world isn't like that. This hyper individualism is a race to the bottom because it makes the very idea of the common good seem like an irrational choice. Those who developed game theory and its policy offshoot, public choice theory, these guys even went so far as to argue that the mathematical methods could be used to prove that there's no such thing as the common good in the first place. They transformed the way we think about politics as if it's a marketplace in which we are completely selfish individuals entering to maximize only our own gain when we vote for someone or greenlight a policy. And because they were staunch defenders of American capitalism during the Cold War, they made it their mission to develop this so it would make complete violent selfishness synonymous with reason. They based their ideas of justice not on the agreements people make in a democratic process, a method far too irrational and unmathematic. And instead, justice became redefined as how do we get the biggest expected utility possible. And since we can never actually measure utility directly, the only thing left to judge policy on was if it gave someone the possibility of becoming an uber billionaire, regardless of how many lives we ruin or acres of rainforest we burn to get there. the expected value of the ends justify the means. This is how we were left with neoliberalism with gutting public housing, education, child care, and healthcare so that middlemen could get richer siphoning off more of our money when things go private. Wealth redistribution from the top was out of the question since, oh, just look at the table. The oho important incentives would just never be as good for our great selfish billionaires. But it is so obvious that making the world a place where everyone is in the same race to become a billionaire, where collective distrust and maximizing individual returns with no concern for how many people need to be stomped on to do so means destroying everything. Destroying the possibility that everyone can thrive. We don't all need to have the hope of becoming billionaires to be happy. But we live in a world of billionaires getting out of jail free while everyone else is slowly chiseling away at their 10 years. This is what neoliberalism was built on, on formulas that claim they can prove what we ought to do, sneaking past us the assumption that our only goal should be coming out on top. But people don't actually think the way these models say they do. People in the real world often make decisions collaboratively, selflessly, with different goals in mind, acting inconsistently, and with more than one preference, caring about process and not just outcomes, and certainly not just themselves. This isn't irrational. It isn't inefficient. It is capital G good. It is what keeps us in community. Nothing is ever like the models. So why try to build a society where even the models suck?

Day two of building the kind of movement, the kind of organization and struggle we need to carry the trust of NSA Sharif, to carry the words of Hassam Shabbat to continue building our struggle for Gaza and for the struggle for the liberation of Palestine. [Music] Let's get another one. Make some noise. Walking around the conference yesterday, it's clear that in the second conference, we have grown as a movement. We've learned so many lessons. We've built so many relationships. We've come together. How could we not? We're in the legacy of a 100year struggle by the Palestinian people for liberation. 100 years of resistance to Zionism and to imperialist colonization. And we're in a long struggle here, too. Our struggle didn't start on October 7th. We have people who have been fighting for years right here in Detroit, across the Midwest, all across America. People who face the same repression we see today. People who were attacked by the Zionist lobby, by Apac, by right-wing politicians and persevered and continued. And so when we feel under threat, when we feel under attack, what do we do? What do we do? >> Stand up. >> What do we do? >> Stand up. >> That's right. We will never back down. They can cut out any of our legs and we will stand again. So many of these leaders have taught us that lesson. There are too many to name, but we want to uplift a few of them now. Palestinians organizers working here in North America to build a revolutionary movement against colonization and for liberation. I'm going to uplift a few names, but know that this is just a drop in the bucket. Samir, a passionate leader and mentor. Samir was dedicated to fostering solidarity for Palestine and committed to empowering youth and students to transform them into political leaders. Um, Ilas Shamy was the first president and founder of the Palestinian-American Women's Association and a member of the Palestinian National Council. Edward Sahed, a name I know all of you know, was a Palestinian American scholar, critic, and public intellectual, best known for his work orientalism, but known also for lifelong support of Palestinian rights. Muna OD, a longtime activist and organizer. Muna was part of Palestinian-American Women's Association in Detroit and later became a member of PAWA, a convening organization of this conference in the steering committee in California. Make some noise from Unod. Fouad Rafidi was a champion of the Palestinian cause since entering the United States in 1975, quickly becoming a major figure in the general union of Palestinian students while attending Youngsttown State University. Om and Abu Muhammad, pillars of the Palestinian community in Chicago, the largest community in North America. They founded the Chicago Club. They consistently created spaces to build community in the far diaspora and to uplift Palestinian culture. And finally, Ali Kasid, born in born in three years before the neck, Ali Kasid worked tirelessly to organize Palestinian communities in Brooklyn, in New Jersey, across the US, in Youngstown, in many other Midwestern loces and also in Algeria. Ali was a dedicated community organizer, a visionary political thinker, and someone who understood at an early time that for our struggle to succeed, we need to build with all elements that face US imperialism and the enemies that are the enemies of the Palestinian people. We need to go deep into our communities and build the kind of organization and infrastructure carried required to carry a 100-year struggle forward. And we need to place faith in our youth and to understand that this one, this struggle is a struggle that has passed from generation to generation. Alasa didn't just hold this in his vision. His life was a testament to it. His daughter Rama, my co-m is one of the many children of this list of people. So many of them are here today living proof that despite any Zionist attempts, despite the vile words of Goldmayer, the young will never forget and the old will never die. This is just a handful of dedicated organizers, lifelong activists and strugglers here in North America. And as we go forward, let us reflect on them. Let us ground ourselves in them. We are in their legacy. Brothers and sisters, we're now going to transition to our first panel of the day. Gaza resists. Gaza remains. Our panelists will ground us in the conditions of the genocide in Gaza. They will help us understand what is at stake, what this fight is really about, life and the right of the people of Gaza to remain. I now will call to the stage our first panelists and I will pass the microphone to Mali, an organizer with the Palestinian Youth Movement, someone you've all seen on the streets for months leading us in protest, leading us in chance and building in our communities and spaces. Thank you. >> Good morning, everyone. I'm really honored to be here today and to be your moderator today for this incredible panel. Welcome to our first plenary of the day. Gaza resists. Gaza remains. In the last two years, we've seen a thoroughly planned and deliberate attack on Gaza in what can only be described as a campaign of annihilation and total destruction of Palestinian people, land, life, and future. Israel's scorched earth policy has decimated the very infrastructure that is meant to sustain any form of life. We've seen entire areas reduced to rubble, targeted assassinations, total destruction of hospitals and schools, and we've also seen the targeted use of engineered famine and starvation to carry out this barbaric genocide. The theme of this panel grounds us in the material conditions and reality on the ground. Our panelists and their experiences will shed insight into what our duty to Gaza's people is in this moment and how we can both support Gaza based initiatives while fighting to bring those responsible for the genocide to justice. I'm honored to be joined by our guest speakers today. >> Please help me in welcoming Dr. Rasan Abueta. Dr. Rasan Abuitta is a British Palestinian plastic and reconstructive surgeon. He completed his medical education at the University of Glasgow in the UK and his post-graduate residency training in London. He later underwent three fellowships. Pediatric cranialacial surgery at Great Orman Street Hospital for Sick Kids. Cleft surgery at GOS and a further fellowship in trauma reconstruction at the Royal London Hospital. In 2011, he was recruited by the American University of Beirut Medical Center. In 2012, he became head of the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the AUBMC, clinical lead of its pediatric war injuries program and war injuries multiddisciplinary clinic. In 2015, co-founded and became director of the conflict medicine program at Global Health Institute at the American University of Beirut. He returned to the UK in 2020 and continues in plastic and reconstructive surgery in the private sector. He is an honorary senior clinical lecturer at the center for blast injury studies at Imperial College University of London and visiting senior lecturer at the conflict and health research group at King's College London University. He's clinical lead for the operational trauma initiative at the World Health Organization's EMRO office and serves on the board of directors of INRA, a charity dedicated to providing reconstructive surgery to war injured children in the Middle East and board of trustees of the UK-based medical aid for Palestinians. He serves on the UK's National Institute of Health Research International Funding Committee. He has published extensively on the health consequences of prolonged conflict and on war injuries including a medical textbook reconstructing the war injured patient and treating the war injured child. He has worked as a war surgeon in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, South Lebanon, and during the four year four wars in the Gaza Strip. On the 9th of October 2023, he entered the Gaza Strip and worked in a Shifa hospital and then a Baptist hospital for 43 days during the current genocide. Evidence he provided was part of the South African submission to the International Court of Justice and in the ICC arrest warrants. In April 2024, he was elected Lord Director of the University of Glasgow and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the American University of Beirut, where he is currently professor of conflict medicine. His work was featured by numerous newspapers and media outlets, notably Lamond, The Independent, Telegraph, BBC, and CNN. Please help me in welcoming Dr. Rasan. We are we are also joined in person by Mosab Abu Toha. Mosab is a Palestinian poet and writer from Gaza. His first collection of poetry, Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear, was a finalist for the National Book Critic Circle Award for poetry and won a Palestine Book Award, an American book award, and the World Cup Poet Poetry Prize. Abu Dha is also the founder of the Edward Sahed Library in Gaza, whose two branches Israel destroyed in 2024. He won the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for commentary and a 2024 overseas press club award for his letter from Kaza columns for the New Yorker. His new book, Forest of Noise, was named a New York Times notable book and was long listed for the Dylan Thomas Prize. Also joining us in person is Hani Al- Madhun. Hani is the co-founder of the Gazda Soup Kitchen, a grassroots effort that provides daily hot meals. A grassroots effort that provides daily hot meals and direct assistance to families in Gaza, including his own. Despite serving as senior director of philanthropy at ona USA, Hy felt compelled to take direct action as famine spread. Coordinating from Washington DC, he fundraises and advocates internationally while his family and community on the ground cook and distribute food under bombardment. His work blends personal loss with humanitarian action, turning grief into sustenance for thousands of Palestinians. Welcome, and I'm looking forward to our discussion. Our first question is going to be directed to Dr. Hassan Abueta. Dr. Hassan, you've spoken and written extensively on Israel's barbaric assault on hospitals and the health sector as one that's definitive of its assault on life in Gaza. Can you speak about the current state of medicine and healthcare in Gaza? What is Israel's political goal behind attacking hospitals, placing a siege, and creating starvation? >> First of all, thank you very much for this invitation. Um, I'm sorry I can't be with you. Um, ever since I served in Kaz during the marches of return and the uh um move by the American administration of its embassy to Jerusalem, I despite having a British passport was banned from uh um visiting the United States. So we'll have to do with this zoo. So it was very clear from the very beginning of this genocide that Israel had really reinvented the idea of scorched earth policy to one which deals with a world where the majority of the population doesn't live in rural areas and therefore need to be napalmed and agentoriented but lives in urban environment for environment. the health structures, the health system needs not to just to be attacked but to be dismantled. And by that I mean we started on the 12th of October with phone calls to every medical director of every hospital in Gaza ordering them to evacuate these hospitals. uh otherwise they would uh bear the responsibility for the uh imminent acts and this was of October 2023. Then on the 7th of October of uh Ali Baptist Hospital where an Israeli missile was fired into the fourcourt of the hospital killing 483 civilians and then the systematic destruction that followed. you know the three pediatric hospitals in the north then the first siege of Shifa and so on and so forth until now we're left with three partially functioning hospital out of 39 and this is despite the fact that every time the Israelis have destroyed the hospital our Palestinian colleagues have reopened it the Indonesian hospital which is in Jabalia was fixed three times by our colleagues and reopened Lauda hospital in Jabalia camp kept working until only a month ago until it was forced to close despite being shelled, despite having snipers fire into it, despite losing three of its doctors in an Israeli missile attack, despite the arrest of its medical director, Dr. Ahmed Muhammad. So that component is is the destruction of um buildings. We then have the systematic murder of a whole generation of health workers. So now over 1,600 have been killed. The the most recent is the head of pediatrics at Naser Hospital in Kyunis. But also from early October uh we were working in Shifa and every day one of our colleagues would be killed within half an hour of going home to their house. It was first uh Dr. Hatam, a plastic surgeon working with us uh uh at the burns unit and then Dr. Ham and now we have a horrendous number. We have whole specialties that have been completely wiped out. You then having taken out the human element, you create the conditions for uh death, you weaponize water and sewage by also from the very beginning from October 23 uh bombing the water desalination plants in Raz and the sewage treatment plants in Raz and then systematically destroy the water and sewage infrastructure so that we have rare diseases on epidemic levels. Gon Barry syndrome which is a virus. Uh uh we have over 85 cases in have a rate of polio also to increase the the rate of genocidal killing and then at the end to weaponize people's bodies against themselves. the famine that Israel has manufactured men means that our colleagues are now reported patients are not surviving surgeries that should they should be thriving because when they're injured they're too malnourished to withstand the TR or to heal the wound after the surgery and and the surgeons and the doctors and the nurses all too malnourished to be able to finish these shifts to work to help these people And so what Israel has done is really created a machinery of a genocide where everything is weaponized from the water to the sewage to the buildings to every little thing. So that unlike what the published numbers are 65,000 traumatic deaths that have registered, the real number most likely closer to 400,000, more than 12 to 15% of Gaza's population because Israel was able to weaponize life itself as part of its genocidal project. As the IDF continuously targets writers, thinkers, and cultural institutions, what has this war done to education and cultural life, and what new forms have they taken since the start of the war. >> Okay. Um, good morning everyone. It is a great honor to be at this room with every one of you. It is another great honor to be in a room that is named after Anis Sharif. May God may Allah bless his soul. And I pre I pray for the safety and well-being of our fighters, the Palestinian journalists have been uncovering and exposing the Israeli genocide when we know that many Western journalists are trying to discredit discredit them by citing what Israel is saying about them. So let's pray for the Palestinian journalists, the fighters on the ground who have been exposing Israel and showing it's a true face. The face that we as Palestinians who have been living in Palestine have been seeing for over 77 years. Not only 70, but 77 over 77 years. I don't think I don't think that we can separate Israel's attacks on hospitals in Gaza from Israel's attacks on universities, on schools, on pharmacies, on kindergartens, or even Israel's attacks on fishermen in the sea and even Israel's attacks on the waves of the sea because Israel wants to annihilate everything that is Palestinian, even the stones that Palestinian children used to to play with. So that's that's a very important point to raise. As to my remarks, it's been the Israeli occupation tactic to murder, imprison, and intimidate Palestinian artists and writers. Hassan Kafani, who was who was living in exile after the occupation of Palestine in 1948, was assassinated in Beirut in July 1972. at the age of 36. My dear friend Rafat who was born and lived in Gaza occupied Palestine was killed in December 2023 at the age of 44. Kneafani was killed alongside with alongside his niece Lamese while Al was killed along with his uh two two siblings and four nephews. And four months later, Rifad's eldest daughter, Shamat. And by the way, Shamat was uh you the U in his poem, If I Must Die, because Rif wrote that poem in 2011. So when he said, "If I must die, you must live to tell my story." The you in that poem was Sha and Sha was killed four months after. So we all should think that the you in this poem is every one of us who should live to tell the story of Rif, of Rahman, of of an of every single Palestinian of every single Palestinian whose voice whose life has been taken by Israel and whose photos are not shown on Western mainstream media for from the fifth from the five months imprisonment of Palestinian poet Darin Tatur for reading a poem of hers to the death of to the death on in prison of Palestinian novelist Wed Daka who was the longest serving Palestinian prisoner in Israel in Israeli jails having spent 38 years in prison. Israel continues to embody the cancerous nature of occupation. In 2021, Wed Daka was diagnosed with cancer, prompting calls for his release upon completion of his original sentence in 2023. But he had received a fourth a further two-year sentence in 2018 for smuggling a mobile phone to prisoner. On January 17th, 2024, the Israeli military detonated 315 mines to destroy the Gaza Strip's last standing university, al-Israel University in southern Gaza. According to to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, just 6 months into the Israeli genocide, more than 5.479 479 students, 261 teachers, and 95 university professors have been killed in Gaza, and over 7,819 students and 756 teachers have been injured. At least 60% of educational facilities, including 13 public libraries, have been damaged or destroyed. And at least 600 625,000 students had no access to education until today. Another 195 heritage sites, 227 mosques and the three churches have been now it's four churches have been damaged or destroyed including the central archives of Gaza containing 150 years of history. Despite the challenges, teachers and volunteers can be found opening tents just like other volunteers are trying to feed people. There are other teachers and volunteers who have been trying to educate the young generation in Gaza the future of Palestine in tents in dangerous areas. For example, my wife's sister Joaher has been trying to conduct fun and educational activities for the children in her school shelter in Bethl which they had to evacuate. She only paused these activities when there was when there were air strikes near the school or when armed Israeli quadcopters issued warnings or made terrifying sounds. My cousin Hassan, who is a trainer and development specialist, established a large tent in Gaza City that attracted over two 2,700 children and adults. My friend Nabil from Der Balah in southern Gaza posted on his Facebook shortly after the failed ceasefire agreement was announced that he was seeking a language tutor for his 11-year-old child. Education in Palestine is is a source of pride and strength for its people. The catastrophe of 1948 made 80% of the population in Palestine displaced, most of them until today. The Palestinian people have witnessed the loss of 85% of their land. This percentage has increased due to the Israeli ongoing occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Despite the lack of institutional stability afforded to them through Israeli occupation and the continued destruction of schools and universities in Gaza, Palestinians maintain a a national literacy rate of 97.7%. It is because education it is because education remains one of the most essential and powerful ways to resist occupation. It is how Palestinians hold on to their homeland and it is how they invite others to visualize it based on our own experiences and also imagine it the way we hope to find it. The two branches of the Edward Sahed public library that I established in 2017 and 2019 were destroyed. It took each package of books many weeks to arrive in Gaza before I placed each book on the shelves. But just in a few seconds, everything was gone and even including the library that I created in my own house. Many of them signed by American authors. Now my hope that I will rebuild the two libraries and more with the help of my friends all over the world just like I did eight years ago remains. But unfortunately one of the libraries of the Edward Sed libraries in Gaza. One of the librarians at the Edward S public library in Gaza was killed in December 2023 along with her whole family du mas. I know that dua's hope is that we open the libraries to make the children less traumatized. We resist by continually hoping, working, and inviting others to join our fight for freedom. Freedom is collective and hope is an action. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is to Hani. Hani, you have worked for decades in humanitarian aid in Gaza through organizations like Onora and through more grassroots initiatives like the Gaza Soup Kitchen. Since the siege and starvation campaign have intensified, we're seeing a concentrated attack on all aid efforts which are now being replaced with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Can you speak boo? Can you speak to the impact the GHF has had on aid distribution at large? What is the reality on the ground right now for those risking their lives to provide aid and for those who are in a critical state of needing this aid? >> Right. Can you hear me? Okay. All right. Thanks everyone. Uh being under the spotlight makes me nervous. Usually when I am under the spotlight, I've been asked questions by people with badges. All right, I tried. Uh, Michigan is a tough crowd. In Chicago, people love this joke, FYI. Uh, uh, I just want to give you a quick update. Unwa remains in Gaza. They are operational underground. Thank you. They are responding though aid is not being allowed in there but every day honora doctors see about 15,000 patients that's the size of Madison Square Garden of people who are not feeling well and honor is responding to that need so please make sure people know that honor remains in the ground the best thing the Zionist would love for you is to think it's not responding and honor was there it is struggling link, but they remain in Gaza. The staff are in Gaza. Uh we started the Gaza Sue Kitchen uh when this genocide began and I'm here in my Gaza soup kitchen capacity and not underway capacity because I want to get real with you and you know when these clips show up these sites I want that that to be cleared. We started because we were tired of, you know, a lot of these entities who were not or we stopped from delivering food to the north and our own family was struggling. We did it because my neighbors were like, "Hey, please, we need to eat for the first two months. Every single grain and every single pasta in Gaza was gone." And what we did was try to do from what's available. Then chef Mahm he started cooking for the community foraging common malow pcelain and it fed the community for 2 months. There was some especially in an area in BL calledatra. There was some potatoes. He bought 800 kilos one time. He bought zucchinis, carrots, anything he can find. These zucchinis were supposed to be small and you know for kusam mashi but they were the size of a pumpkin because nobody dared to go pick him up from the plants. So we cooked for the community. You couldn't really do kusam mashi from those gigantic ones. So we kept the community alive and we kept doing this and unfortunately you know because we've done a lot of work the moment the Israelis noticed our work when we were helping and the good doctor will know Dr. Husam Safia at the Camela Adwan Hospital. He was basically in speed dial calling my brother Shiff Mahmood come deliver food for the community and we would we would come up when the Israelis did not have exhilarant in one of the last invasion for Kamalan. They collected and it was November they collected all the blankets and they used those to set up the fire in the second floor. So that's and everybody was without a blanket. She Mahmud showed up the next day with blankets and rice and diapers and a lot of these things and few days later they will kill Mahmood because of what he did for the community. They sent a drone waited for him outside and they killed him. >> They thought that we will stop working but we did not. Every single family member of ours, every single crew, they said no, people will still starve after Chef Mahmood. and they kept cooking for the community. This is not a slogan. I'm tired of slogans. I'm tired of empty speeches. We wanted to make sure Oh, thank you. We want to make sure our family have food and our neighbors are taken care of and to the best of our ability when the famine was in June and July. We the family and this is sad. Our family was the only operation that remained without closing their door. shame on the word central h kitchen for closing in Gaza leaving the community and chef Jose Andrew Andre whatever his name is he's yes yes yes he says he's very political in Russia Ukraine he has no sympathy for the Russians but when it comes to Israel can we all get along he never talks about our suffering he thinks it's a misfortune oh yeah he whitewatches this and his former staff write me in the DM tell me a lot of these horrors. So this is this is the precursor for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and remember a lot of their staff were killed and the best they could do is ask for an investigating and they never pushed for one. They never cared for facts. They just did not want to upset Israel. I'm responsible for those words. So now is Anthony here? Anthony the guy who set GHF on fire. I saw him last night. the former security contractors who really spoke truth. Are you here, Anthony? Can we give him a shout out? If you see him, make sure to thank him. He spoke the truth and he made a big impact about the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. What I've learned from Anthony yesterday that this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation hires people who are from motorcycle club called the infidels motorcycle club. They think the crusade war still alive. They all have crusade tattoos and these are the kind of over undereducated overgrown juvenile they sent to Gaza right now. These people pepper spray the Palestinians. They're ready to see Palestinians dead. Not all of them are like that, but the majority of them, many of them, in fact, the founder of the company that ships these contractors to Gaza cannot leave the state of North Carolina because has some charges against him. That's the kind of morally shady characters that run this operation in Gaza. Do not believe anything about these guys. They're not being funded by any entity or government. There is a an Israeli American tech guy who's bankrolling this initiative and also the US government is defending them because they want to undermine UNROWA and guess what they are building a concentration camp inside middle area now in Gaza where they going to have people live there and they going to distribute food that's why we need your advocacy we talk too much we care too much about this but I'm gonna I know I'm I don't see the time thing but stop me when I I I I finish, but I just want to let you know a couple of things. One, please be invested in the political process in this country. Do not resign from it. It's disgusting. I know, but we have to be in the room. Some of these politicians are in sale. Our community should have our members of Congress that we can call. Some of them you can with a $50,000 contribution they will go to a trip to Gaza. Some of these people, you know, they spend the summer in Tel Aviv and they claim to represent America and they love the US. But the first call comes from BB Netanyahu. They answer. Yes. Two, please, please, please run for office as much as you can. We need you to run for office and and and try. You know, we're here. We're Congresswoman Rashida. She's amazing. We need 10 more inshallah. And then also support initiatives like the IMEU, like this group because we also need that power. We need the Institute for Middle East Understanding, the Rethink Media because they tell our stories. So also invest in those institutions. Support. Yes. Support the Gaza Soup Kitchen. And by the way, we are incorporated in Michigan. The Gaza Soup Kitchen was incorporated in Michigan. for the simple fact I live in Virginia and at the time the government of Virginia was going after Palestine charities and I said you know we should go to Michigan because that's where our people are and these there's a lot of people who make sense here so we're based here continue to speak out share as much as you can about this and please center the voices of Gaza maybe Musab doesn't want you to know this now but Musav and I are fighting with Georgetown what did Georgetown do. >> Yeah, they reached out. >> So, Georgetown did a conference about Gaza. They had amazing speakers we love and respect. And guess what? Zero person from Gaza. Zero person with a family in Gaza. >> Yes. So, please remember, we're all proud of the speakers, but remember, we need people who are actually in the front line fighting this and paying the price with that. Thank you. Thank you, Hannie. On that note, on on talking about, you know, what we can do here in the US and across North America, we're all aware that GZA is being starved by Israel as we speak. And as Hani spoke to, Israel and the United States have turned aid into a weapon of war and starvation as a primary strategy in executing their genocide. So this next question is posed to all three of our panelists. In the midst of this man-made famine, then what is the responsibility of people outside of Gaza? >> Um okay, I will start. Um Dr. is with us. >> Okay. Uh I think the the responsibility of people in this country is greater than any people anywhere else in the world because this country we know is funding the genocide. I mean espe I mean it it feels more painful for me personally that I am a Palestinian. I'm from Gaza and there are many many Palestinians here. But for us as Palestinians who are living here, whether we are Palestinian students, whether we are Palestinian Americans who are who were born here, I mean, it's very painful for us to know that some of the money, some of the taxes, the taxes that we pay goes to kill people in Gaza. So, we have to fight more, you know, to make sure that the money the taxes that we are paying should be going to helping people, not killing them. So we have to to to make an effort to make this clear to uh to the Congress people in each state that we do not want at least our own money us Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, anyone who sees the humanity of the people in Palestine. Not only not only in Gaz but also in the West Bank there is occupation. There are settlers 16 17 years old with M16s attacking people who have planted the the land for for decades. So we have to make sure that our voices are heard that this money that we are paying the taxes we are paying should be going to help people to help the people whose occupation we are enabling. So the the responsibility lies on everyone. Um so I think again I'm I'm saying this again and again I think we should make this very clear to the government to the Congress people that we don't want our taxes to be going to Israel especially that is that especially that it is going it is carrying out a live stream genocide. Um and I think also that another way of contributing to um helping our people in Gaza and the West Bank is helping uh groups like Gaza Soup Kitchen. Uh because they are doing things on the ground. They are not raising funds only. But you can see everything that they are doing. You can see Han's parents, Han's friends, Han's community. It is it is a locallyun initiative. It's not like we need American people to give us food. We don't want anyone to help us. We can help ourselves, but at least what we need what we need is that this country and other countries do not send weapons to Israel. We don't want them to send to fund the bulldozers that are raising our farms because Israel destroyed a lot of the farms that we were using to eat and feed others. Early this month, Israel killed my father-in-law, my wife's father. He's a he was a strawberry farmer. So, he was he was someone who was supposed to be bringing strawberry to us, to his parents, to his relatives, to his sisters. But instead he was going to one of the aid crossing uh in north Gaza the Zikiman because he wanted to bring food to his wife and children but he was killed in an air strike. >> So he was so so we don't I I mean it is painful for me that he was killed but the way he was killed that he was going to to get food. This this man is not supposed to go and get food. He should be coming with food to other people. But Israel destroyed his farm. Israel destroyed his house and Israel destroyed him. So we want to put an end to the genocide by by asking by by demanding that our own tax money doesn't go to this genocidal country. And again we are not a people who are needy and you know that we are not needy people. We are people who can who can eat from what our hands produce. We educate ourselves. We feed ourselves. We do not want to rely on aid. I don't like to call it aid because this we don't we we we are not people who rely on aid. But unfortunately, this country has I mean Israel and the United States and many European countries have have made it made sure that we rely on aid. We don't want to rely on it. We have hands. We have feet. We we wake up in the very early morning to plant and to harvest and to water. We want to eat from what we do. We don't want to rely on money. What should be done is to stop sending weapons to Israel. >> Yes. >> I mean Isra Israel is making sure that we do not get the food that we need through Enra through Gaza soup kitchen and but on the other hand no one is stopping the weapons from going to Israel. There is no police at the border between Israel and Jordan or even in the in the air to check how many weapons Israel is getting every single day to check how what kind of weapons Israel is getting. But there are there there are lots of policemen at the gates of Gaza, checking how many bars of chocolates are entering Gaza, how many litters of waters are getting into Gaza, what kinds of medicine is getting into Gaza. This is not fair. Thank you. [Applause] Do you want me to start now or do you want to go ahead or how do you want to do this? >> Yes. >> Dr. Hassan, if if you can speak, you can speak now. Sure. So I don't think there should be any doubt in anybody's mind that this is a an American, British, German, French, Italian, Dutch genocide. Uh and that Israel is not an ally of the United States in the West, but a continuation, an appendage of Western imperialism. And that what we have seen the way that the system lit up when Israel decided to start its genocidal project. From every little community college to university to main universities to institutions to financial institutions, factories to educational and intellectual uh institutions. Israel is plugged in to every facet of every institution that represents Western power. What we've also seen and learned over the last two years is the effect of the systematic destruction of organized labor in the United States, in North America, in Europe, and particularly in the United Kingdom, and the destruction of meaningful opposition to the ruling classes in these countries. We also have seen and have understood that and have always understood that colonialism is an economic equation. And just like the very same French right and military who brought the gold to power in the second time in the 50s. uh uh uh uh these very same people in order to support the colonial project in Algeria. When the Gaul found himself having to choose between the uh um continuation of the French Republic and the continuation of the colonial project in Algeria, he threw the pedoir under the bus. Colonialism remains an economic and political project. And therefore our job, those of us who live in the global north, is through destabilization to ensure that the cost of that colonial project increases, throughization, through mobilization, through reaching out and organizing along labor, along student movements, along uh uh ethnic minority groups, every aspect ect of every marginalized community whether they are marginalized along class or along race. We need to mobilize them because the ruling classes of the west fear nothing like they fear instability and a politicized and politically aware population that is no longing from one imperialist war to the other. Our job is to mobilize in our communities and nationally wherever we are in order to destabilize these uh these imperialist projects, in order to make colonialism not worth their while as we managed to do in Vietnam, as we managed to do in Algeria. Another thing is litigation. As a community here, we have the power to legate litigate these bad actors and there is so many of them. There is no reason why GHF is not being sued right now by 50 other lawsuits. There should we should do a lot of that. That AI company that is doing the technology, she should they also should be sued. My brother Majid is the first of my siblings to be killed with his family. We have reasons to believe that it was an AI calculation that destroyed the house where he lives and the cat lucky and his wife and the whole family. So this is one other thing we have to litigate. we have this thing and I know Mahm Khalil is here and you should take inspiration by how he fought that's that's the other aspect we can do in addition to running for office and all of that and and please I hope you understand where I'm coming from for my next point is do not let the Israelis and the Zionists in this country to have monopoly over the American flag in their rallies and protesting and all that. It should always be present in our rallies and activities because we do not do this work alone. We do not hate this country. We love this country. We hate the genocidal cult whether it's the guys who were in the last administration who owned this in mess or their current administration. I really want you to think about this. When yesterday I came, there was some guy with an Israeli flag and an American flag. Rarely do we see it in our rallies. I hope you understand where I'm coming from because this is something that we have to connect with the rest of America on. The ones who are making the most sense right now are Tucker Carlson and the congresswoman from Georgia. And we have to appeal to a broader coalition tomorrow in Gaza where this is important. We are doing a food distribution. My family is doing a food distribution. Guess what? Inside it the church that offered them the space. And what makes this food distribution and this is a about fi 500 food parcel unique is it's paid for and supported by an amazing coalition of more than a thousand rabbi a thousand rabbis who signed in a petition to bring more food into Gaza. They have a group called Jews for food aid to the people of Gaza and they've been organizing not only just donating but also going to these office and speeches and some of them are being detained. Remember we're not alone in this fight. There is allies that you don't even know exist. Onora USA sees this support from people from across. So we're not alone. Remember continue to do this and also speak well. And it's not only that we run the soup kitchen. Musab and I always in the media talking about our families. We're talking about our struggle. It is all of the above approach. You know, you've seen this. You've struggled. You've taken over campuses and now they're fighting back against you. Some of you's diplomas been the VCU students. Sabrina, is she here? I saw her yesterday. She also stood her ground and ultimately they came around because the tide is shifting and I only wish the cost wasn't this high. We already have more than enough victims in Gaza. Continue to talk about them, continue to engage, honor their memories and support in all the ways you can. There's so many fronts to this battle and we are in all those as much as we can and we're not alone. Thank you. Thank you. I wanted to continue on this thread that Dr. Hassan had opened about colonialism being an economic equation and political project. And so for this next question that's directed to the three panelists on the theme of everything being weaponized by Israel on weaponizing life itself as part of this genocide. Can we speak to the political goals beside behind the destruction of what you mentioned Mossad, the destruction of cultural archives, the attacks on memory and future generations of Palestinians, the political goals behind undermining ona and the political goals behind, you know, destruction of hospitals, starvation as a weapon um of war. So, >> okay, thank you for the question. Um we all know this saying by one of the first u Israeli officials that the old people will die and the young people Palestinians will forget. So their fight with us is what is about not only killing us, annihilating us, but also um erasing the memory, the memory that we had of Palestine. For me, as someone who was born in a refugee camp, um it remains a very devastating reality that not only did Israel turn 80% of the population of Palestine in 1948 into refugees, but now what Israel is after is the is the refugee camps. Out of the eight refugee camps in Gaza, Israel erased the three of them, Jabalia, Rafa, and Kunes. they erased the three refugee camps. So this eraser of the refugee camps is also uh another component of their attempt to erase the refugee question. This is one of the questions that they will never get rid of because as long as we are alive, we will continue to demand our rights, our right to return. My my grandfather my my grandfather Hassan uh was born in Yafa and also my grandmother Khadra was born in Yafa. They became refugees. Uh they moved to live in Ashhata refugee camp. My father was born there. I was born there. Um so the refugee camp should have been a temporary place for the Palestinian people. But unfortunately over years it has become home for them. Now as many people left the Jabal refugee camp and the Rafa refugee camp and the Kus refugee camp, many of the people who are now concentrated on the beach of Canunis or Dalah now their hope is to return to the refugee camp. They miss the refugee camp. So this is something that that it is a devastating reality but Israel is doing it and we the world is watching it and the world is doing nothing. It's not that the world is doing nothing. You know that the world is doing a lot of things which is funding the genocide of the Palestinian people but they are doing nothing to save the Palestinian people. 70% of the population in Gaza are refugees. So every time we see names, every time we see numbers of people who are killed by Israel, you should always keep in mind that 70% of those people were refugees. So these people were supposed to return to their homes in Yafa, in Hifa, in Aka, in Jerusalem, in in Mdal, in in the villages around Gaza, Ham, Jorah, etc. So these people, it's it's not like Israel is committing a genocide against a people they are occupying. This is this is a crime in itself. But I mean the the other crime that Israel is committing is killing is is is killing refugees. So you are not killing someone who you are occupying but you are killing someone you you have turned into a refugee for 77 years. So that that's another level of a genocide that I rarely hear anyone talk about in the media or anywhere. Um but we will resist that. Um and we have been resisting this. I remember when I was a very small child at the age let's say of nine or 10 whenever I introduced myself to new friends let's say we meet in a mosque we meet in a playground we meet in a football club soccer club I would introduce myself mentioning my name uh and so my name and our original home city Yafa so I would say my name is Musabya I wouldn't say I'm I'm from the refugee camp. So mentioning the name of the original city of our grandparents is an integral part of who we are and we are going to continue saying this. This is why Israel this is why Israel wants to shut the UN the United the ENRA United Nations Relief and Work Agency. It's not that ONRA has any political leanings. It has any agendas. No, no, no. Just forget about all these accusations. Israel wants to get rid of Onra because it is a reminder of the refugee problem. As long as there is UNRA, it means there are refugees and as long as there are refugees, ONRA should remain and we should continue to support UNRA and its work because not it's not only about uh providing aid to the Palestinian people. I was a refugee as I said, now I'm an exile. My family relied on aid from ONRA, not only food but also the clinics in in Gal because every time we think about ONRA, we think about uh food, you know, rice and oil and sugar, blah blah blah, but also ENRA has been providing Palestinian people, the refugees with medical uh with medical support. When I felt sick, I go to an HNRA clinic in Jabalia. Now it's destroyed. And I attended HNRA schools also as a as a child. And then I became a teacher. I taught students at honorra schools in bethanun and in betahi and jabari. So they will fail because we know that no matter how long a thief keeps your your property it will remain your property which is yafa palestine and they will remain they will remain thieves. Now they are not only thieves but they are child killers. They are sexual abusers and these crimes are documented and unfortunately it pains me that we are not only telling these stories just as they happen but the Palestinian journalists one of them and Sharif God bless his soul they were live streaming this they were not only telling hi Mus please tell your friends that there is a massacre in Jabalia there is the Israel is advancing the Israel bomb the no it's not that we they are telling us those things but we are seeing this I mean I don't know what else the Palestinian people in Gaza and also in the West Bank because we also have videos of settlers attacking Palestinians, stealing their camels, burning their burning their tents and and pouring cement in their water wells. I mean, everything is documented. I mean, what else should the Palestinian people do to show the world that this these people are thugs, these people are criminals, they should be held accountable? What more proofs what more proofs do we have to show? So we have to support UNRA because it is it keeps the record of the Palestinian people. It keeps the record of the Palestinian people. So that that was [Applause] Dr. Vassan, did you want to speak? >> Uh, and I I kind of got cut off when you were speaking, so I didn't know what the question was. The question is on uh the broader political project of colonialism as an economic equation and political equation to speak to the the theme of weaponizing everything including life as a part of this genocide. And so the question was touching on the destruction of cultural archives, the destruction of memory and future generation, the the political goal of undermining onora and the the political goal of starvation as a campaign of carrying as car to carry out this genocide. So to carry on from where uh uh the previous speakers left off, um what we're witnessing in the last couple of weeks with almost the annihilation of all of the journalists in northern Gaza and the systematic targeting of journalists and the increase in the number of doctors that are being denied entry into uh initially it was 50% % and now it's closer to 75%. And then the American administration's decision to uh prevent uh charities from being bringing Palestinian children for treatment in the United States and even a collaborationist government um like the Vichi government Ramla being denied uh visas to enter the United States and speak at the general assembly. This is all an attempt at ghosting Palestinians again. There is a decision, a concerted decision that our faces and our names and our voices and our story should not be told anymore. that one of the problems that the genocidal project is running into is that over a hundred years of dehumanizing Palestinians, of making them invis invisible and voiceless, it is failing. And what is being identified as the causes of this failure are health workers who travel and come back and talk about the atrocities and the monstrosities that are being committed. uh are the journalists who are bravely showing world the crimes that are being committed. Are the children whose wounds when they come to communities in the United States tell their stories about their lives and their damaged bodies and their lives. And so there is decision to make us invisible again. And that's what the American administration wants to do with it. not just the American administration, the European uh uh governments fall into line and most importantly what we've seen in this genocide is what you can call the genocide enablement apparatus you know and this is everything from the BBC to the New York Times to the to uh uh um uh Wall Street Journal to CNN to Fox to every news outlet. It's again to make you invisible as a people again because it's been identified that your humanity gets in the way of a good genocide. uh and uh uh that those people who are filling the streets in the thousands and the tens of thousands if not the hundreds of thousands in the UK, in Australia, uh in Europe, uh are there because they've seen in you their families, they've seen in your children, their children, and therefore Palestinians have to be made invisible again. And that's what we're seeing. And we will see more of this uh because it seems that's the next phase of the attempt at limiting the damage the genocide is causing uh within the genocide countries like the United States and Britain and Germany and France and and Holland and Italy. I think uh what we are witnessing in all those outlets and the stories is that how the Palestinians are the only people on earth who are asked to prove our pain and our suffering. They're like, "Hey, we have a famine." No, no, no. Show us, show us receipts. You have a famine. We have the death of this. Oh, no, no, no. This is not true. Or this kid is starving. Oh, pre-existing. It is the lies, the misinformations, the coverups. I thought when they killed the ambulance workers, the heroic staff, this is the end of it. Oh, no, no, no. It come up always like, oh, we screwed up. That's it. That's just a little screw up. Oopsie. You know, I was cutting myself shaving and that's it. And they do not like people are aware. I assure you. I go to these news news rooms, I hear these conversations. Sometimes the reporters in private are more telling. they lit more and that's also telling because it's the corporations that we are being abused by these the owners of those entities whereas the journalists often times so many of them are you know there is the only reason why for example CNN called so many Palestinian because there's a producer a young person who is Pakistani who is Arab who is Masri who's pushing them to bring a Palestinian voice even with that they We have to be lobbyed to get somebody to get our voice there. And that's why we can't all be lawyers and doctors here. We have to also be writers and storytellers and artists and musicians and poets. So that's one. They always want to see our suffering and you know they're pushing back against owner. Why? Not because owner was bad. Remember the first administration of President Trump defunded. There was no such allegations. This is about mainly about the right of return and it's also about domination and control because a dangerous Palestinian is an educated Palestinian. They hate that there's half a million children in Gaza who go to schools right now. They're just chasing after the water truck because Israel cut the pipe for them. So that's sort of like the struggle we see. What is the situation of aid right now in Gaza? Israel does not allow much aid into Gaza. What has been allowed is commercial trucks. So this is stuff for sale. They've allowed a lot of this. And you remember this is about it meets about 14% of what the Gaza Strip needs. No more than 14%. Agencies like Honora has the equivalent of 6,000 A trucks outside the warehouses. We're waiting and they're not allowing this. Sometimes they allow 10 or 20. But here is the funny thing and I know some of you know this. If an aid truck for sale, the Israelis because they're making money and profit from the commercial truck, they allow armed private security from Gaza to come to pick up the aid. But if it's a humanitarian aid that is going to go to the people for free, they want to make sure it gets looted. And guess what? Three weeks ago, our cousin Tahal Madhun was killed because he was volunteering to protect an aid site, an educated young man who wanted to protect the aid and make sure it gets to these aid agencies. They've killed him and a few other guys who are just good Samaritans, they're trying to prevent the aid from stalling. So this is what we call engineered suffering. So because the aid goes in, people will feel like they got some help. So what is happening is entities like the Gaza Soup Kitchen and other actors. I'm sure the room is filled with amazing people who do great work for Gaza, we end up having to buy the food and give it away for the community for free. So that's why we have to be nimble. You know, a lot of those great organization are sadly are forced to sit on millions of dollars earmarked for Gaza and everybody's waiting in the parking lot for the right moment. Israel allows aid. What they do is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is they're not bringing aid. What Anthony and I talked about, they just grab aid that somebody else brought. They put their logo on it and they say, "We brought this aid." They have truck drivers from Romania and Australia and these beef cakes coming from North Carolina to give us food. Guess what? 1500 Palestinians. That was two weeks ago. At least 1500 Palestinians were killed at those eight sites. personally our recent death in the family. Samir Muhammad Hbil Madun, a young man just turned 18 years old was killed at those sites and he was delivered to our family unclo which is very unusual because Palestinians if you know about the religious tradition when somebody is killed in a situation like Gaza as some will call Shahid he will be buried or she will be buried in the clothes they were killed in. And this guy was delivered naked. And the assumption that the Israelis stripped him before they executed them. And this is the stories. Oh yeah. The stories we deal with. And guess what? They couldn't even get the body from Kunis because the disruption of the road. A man went and grabbed the body and buried it. And they paid. The man had to his name about 30 about a thousand dollar. That's what it cost to buy the plot and bury this person. And too many unknown bodies, too many skeletons. There is boxes of bones with sneakers and they put the sneaker outside with the hope that somebody would recognize this. A Palestinian man who was killed by Israel was recognized through the key chain he had in his their keys. This is the trauma we're dealing with. And I I hope our allies in the room, they understand this and understand that we need action. The Palestinians don't need statements. They don't eat statements. They need food. We need access, not excuses. And Israel knows this and they're amazing amazing at lies. Instead of allowing foreign journalists in and instead of not killing Palestinian journalists, what did they do last week for those who pay attention? They flew in bargain bin Tik Tockers and had them show like, "Hey, come pick up the aid. It's here." Guess what? They're not allowing anybody to go access this aid. It's for a production. and our American ambassador Whitikov when he went there a Palestinian person asked if they could join the trip they said no we're just going family it's the cousins just going to check up this uh killing field that's known in the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation they sent a reporter in to see this and the person puked because they were seeing so much violence and stench of death and did Palestinians around that this This is the reality that we're seeing it and we can talk about it here, but I know it's overwhelming. I know our mental health is not the same. I know my relationship with my daughters and my wife is changed because we live and breathe this and it pales compared to the suffering in Gaza. So, if you are able to help anyone in Gaza to stay in the land as long as they can, please do that. I do not fault anybody who wants to leave but nobody's leaving because they have a choice because they've taken all forms of life including universities and hospitals and I pray soon enough we will have Dr. Husama bafia freed. He did nothing wrong. He did nothing wrong. Thank you. Thank you, Handy. I I just have two things to to follow up with. Um you know, regarding the stories and the memories. Um so every every day um we see the names of people who are killed by Israel. I think that I think to myself that these people who were killed today, they survived over 670 days of the genocide and these people were the carriers of stories that no one no one was told. So these people were eyewitnesses. So, Israel is not only again is not only killing these people but they are also eradicating eyewitnesses who should have been you know sharing their I their witness account with international humanit inter international human rights advocates uh going to the ICC and ICG. So, Israel is not only killing these people, but is it's also eradicating and getting rid of eyewitnesses who should be very important when it comes to holding Israel accountable for its war crimes. The one other the other point that I wanted to share with you is that on October 7th um we hear a lot the the western media, mainstream media saying that Hamas killed Holocaust survivors and they abducted Holocaust survivors. But how many of you heard any any journalist any any journalist saying that Israel until today they killed over 1,000 Nakba survivors. Have you ever heard of that? No. I looked at the names of the people. So this is this is from October 7th until mid June and there are over a thousand Nakba survivors. people who were born before the Nakba in 1948. So these these are Nakba survivors and Israel killed them a thousand people. No one is talking about them. So this is part of the dehumanization. This is part of the story that we should be telling the world. If I must die, you must live to tell my story. And this this is part of the story that we should be telling the world that not only Israel did Israel turn these people into refugees. Not only my grandfather was turned made a refugee in 1948 but he died in the refugee camp and he was buried in a cemetery close to the refugee camp and the cemetery was where he was buried was destroyed by Israel. So we should talk about these things. It's not only about the killing of the people as people but also the stories behind these people. These are Nakba survivors. A thousand people who should have been cared about, who should be brought back to their houses even even if those houses do not exist anymore, but they should go back to the land where the houses existed and we should welcome that. Thank you for your remarks. As we get ready to close this panel soon, I wanted to give the opportunity to our three panelists for closing remarks on this theme of Gaza remaining on this theme of remaining on our land on remaining with our struggle. And so I wanted to open it up for the three panelists for their closing remarks. Dr. Lassan, we can start with you. So I think what is critical at the moment is for us to understand and to make the world understand that is today what will happen to the rest of humanity the rest of this uh uh um century that the genocidal eraser of surplus populations whether they're politically surplus populations like the palist Inians, socially surplus populations like refugees who are drowned intentionally in the Mediterranean or are killed intentionally as they cross borders or economically surplus populations who are chemically uh killed and through the denial of health. We will see these tactics, these philosophies enacted not just in other countries in the global south but in the inner cities and the slums of the north. Quadcopters will be seen in the United States. uh uh these robot uh uh uh drones will be seen in the United States as part of the management of surplus populations. That's the first point. The second point is genocide at the heart of it is the erasure of the possibility of a tomorrow. And there part of our resistance to this erasure is to keep planning for a Palestinian tomorrow and to keep fighting for a Palestinian tomorrow and to keep supporting our Palestinian friends and family and colleagues and comrade as they plan for a day after the genocide while supporting them in their daily struggles to survive. It is critical that we not give up hope. Our people has survived 100 years of colonial erasure and we will survive another hundred years. Three, [Applause] the institutions of power in the west, whether they are the universities or the media, are enemy institutions. And the only way we can free our lives of their malevolent influence is by taking them over. We need to retake the universities. We need to neutralize and silence or at least limit the insidious effect of these corporate media. We need to be able to neutralize and eventually dismantle the uh genocide enablement apparatus that exists. Thank you. Okay. uh closing remarks maybe would be a beginning an invitation to start doing something. Um we all know that there are pal half of the population in Gaza are children. I mentioned in my uh keynote that about 700,000 children are missing schools for two years. Now it is the beginning of the third year. So I'm inviting every one of you to reach out to people in Gaza or people who are working on this thing which is offering classes to students in Gaza even supporting teachers because you know most of the people in Gaza rely before October 7 before the genocide they relied on daily work so many of them do not have any source of income. So I invite you to support any initiative that is supporting the education of children. Uh yesterday I talked to my aunt who lost her 7-year-old child in an airirst strike which she survived herself with her husband and their five children. In that air strike I lost my great aunt, my grandmother's sister and 15 of her relatives, one of whom was my first cousin. Um, so I asked her, "Are are you teaching them anything? Do do they know the letters, the sounds, the, you know, math?" And she said, "No, I'm just, you know, helping them memorize some verses from the Holy Quran." So that's the only available thing and the easiest thing to do in order for a mother to make sure that her children can read Arabic. So, but I think we need to work on projects that would support the education of children and maybe Hani can talk about that if that's part of the work they're doing. I know that ONRA many times because I taught English at Enra schools and uh while I was in Egypt and also part of the time here we were working on WhatsApp groups with students to to to to take some lessons in English. and also in they were teaching the four main subjects English, Arabic, science and math. So I was I was doing this on WhatsApp but the problem was with the u with the electronic devices. Not everyone in Gaza has currently electronic devices like a laptop, a phone or an iPad. The the other problem is with the electricity. It's not easy to charge the phone or the laptop or the iPad. The third larger problem is the internet. There is no internet in Gaza. you can rarely find um that that that service. That's that's why the the journalists were on the fourth floor, the stairs of the fourth floor of the Nasser Hospital. They were trying to catch the signal of the internet in order to post and upload their content. So that that that's that's something that UNRA was trying to do even a year and a half after the genocide started. But it's very very challenging. So my invitation to you is to find and maybe start um educational tents in Gaza, support the teachers there, uh fund some of their the equipment that they need like chalk, like notebooks, like pencils. So this is one thing that you can work on. The other thing we know that between October 7th and uh the the time Israel destroyed the Rafa border crossing in May 2024. So, so that's that's about 8 months. About a 100,000 Palestinians managed to leave Gaza through Egypt. And there are many Palestinian students who are currently in Egypt studying at universities maybe or doing some uh tutor taking less private lessons. So these people need support. So that's another way of supporting the Palestinians who managed to leave Gaza and now are in Egypt, maybe in Jordan, but the majority are in Egypt. So these people 100% need support. Maybe you can find them a scholarship. Maybe you can, you know, contribute to the to the fees. Uh maybe you can start a school in Egypt, a private one because as far as I know uh when I was in Egypt during the first six months, we couldn't register our kids at Egyptian schools. We are not we were not allowed to do that. And I think that's the case until today. So these students, my children, if they were still in Egypt, they couldn't go to an Egyptian public school. We had we had to find them an Irish school, a private one, and we had to pay a lot of money for that. So maybe that's another thing that you can work on, which is to maybe start a private school or maybe fund these students, enable them to go to private schools in order to continue their education. And this is again, this is our weapon, education. We need to have these children whether in Gaza or outside of Gaza. We need them to be well educated so that when we go back to Gaza, to the West Bank, to Yafa, to Hifa, we will be ready to rebuild what Israel has been destroying. Uh, great. Uh, couple of things I'm I'm thinking about is I know a lot of people are on their phones. So, if you could get your phone, Instagram, Gaza Soup Kitchen, follow us, tag us, I'll share it. So, this way you could get our message further, make our voices a little bit louder. If you could do that today, tag the conference, tag the organizers. By the way, please give him a big round of applause for organizing Two, spend your dollars where your values are. This is a good way for us to think about those companies that are hurting the Palestinians, hurting the environment, hurting the African-American community, hurting disadvantaged communities, or they have uh issues with trans or gay or queers. You know, we're allied around this. Gaza brings us together and we also have other investments. We're not just one issue people. It's the most important issue, but we also have lives. Last week, a friend and I spend the time packing backpacks in DC in the heart of the most disadvantaged community to help our communities and give back because we cannot forget our about our role here in this country and make decisions. You know when you see at the grocery store that uh crappy supparum brand make sure your friends from yoga know that this is a bad actor. And then this is one example. You know the overpriced coffee at that company with the slick CEO. Remind them that you care about this. Really it starts at your smallest network. The people you social your book club. They need to know about these things because this is an average American. It has to be mainstream cuz no American wants to see kids starve. And I don't care what Israel say is complicated. It's not complicated. It is not. It is not. And we did it. If you go and see the story we did at the Gaza Soup Kitchen, we did help 1,200 families in about 6 hours. We got 8 to,200 families in 6 hours. We had Thank you. We had trolling signs where we said no GHF, no guns. We had also the American flag there and nobody was hurt. If you look at the statistics of GHF, if they've helped, if distributed 50,000 meals like we did, about 1.5 Palestinians will be killed. So remember, spend your your dollars with your values. And let's give a round of applause for our panelists. Thank you again to our panelists. Thank you for your powerful words. Thank you for grounding us in what genocide looks like, the destruction of all sectors of society. We're [Applause] We outside [Applause] here. >> That's how you make us. >> That's why you make us proud. >> That's how you make us. >> That's why you make us. Gaza makes us proud. Gaza makes us proud. And Gaza also gives us a tremendous responsibility. One of the reasons that we are here today is to push forward that responsibility to figure out how we can participate in alleviating suffering in getting towards restructuring and rebuilding areas that have been destroyed. What is our ability to do that? That is one of our key themes right now. We have fundraising at the door. That's a first step towards carrying forward with the compass of Gaza. You can find people with boxes at the door. We're going to take a short 30 minute break. We'll be back here at 12 exactly for our keynote panel. When you see your friends, we all have a responsibility to fill in. We'll bring them together. See you all at 12:00. [Applause] [Music] down. [Music] Happy [Music] happy happy [Music]
